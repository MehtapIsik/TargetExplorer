3HEG: ends 8 aas from protein C-term - one of four constructs which do this. Protein production references Bukhtiyarova et al. (2007) (1KV1 and 4 others), which states that the full-length sequence was used, plus an N-terminal 7His-tag which was apparently not removed. The SEQRES records for these PDB entries indicate the full-length protein, but without the 7His-tag. So the 3HEG authors probably just added the observed sequence in the SEQRES records. And the Bukhtiyarova et al. authors neglected to include the His-tag sequence (possibly also a linker).
