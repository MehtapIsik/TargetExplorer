1YHS: SEQRES indicates significant truncation at N-term and short significant truncation at C-term. Paper suggests they used full length protein plus 6His-tag. The 6His-tag sequence (plus linker etc.) they mention matches a few other sequences in the PDB. The associated papers reference the 1YHS paper. 1YHS observed residues match the SEQRES records. Thus it seems clear that the 1YHS authors used the observed sequence for the SEQRES records, not the construct sequence. Also, note that all PDB structures are based on the P11309-2 isoform (and are likely all full length), not the UniProt canonical isoform P11309-1, which is longer. A few other PDBs indicate the same construct sequence as 1YHS, e.g. 4K0Y, which cites the 1YHS paper for the expression protocol.
