            Confirmed E coli expression and construct sequence. They used a
            GST-tag with TEV protease cleavage site.

                TEV_cleaved_Nterm ('gh' sequence); one-domain protein; full-length
                construct except two residues at C-term; most other PDB constructs are
                full-length; paper indicates "full-length"; 3QHW authors seem to have input the
                observed sequence in the SEQRES records (including the expression tag)
