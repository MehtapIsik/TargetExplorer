            Confirmed E coli expression and construct sequence. They used a
            GST-tag with TEV protease cleavage site.

                TEV_cleaved_Nterm ('gh' sequence); one-domain protein; full-length
                construct except two residues at C-term; most other PDB constructs are
                full-length; paper indicates "full-length"; 3QHW authors seem to have input the
                observed sequence in the SEQRES records (including the expression tag)

                Paper contains no information on expression protocol. Sequence cannot be confirmed.

            Full-length. Confirmed from paper.

            Paper says that E coli BL21 cells were used as hosts, and the same sequence was expressed as in Nowakowski et al 2002. The latter used insect cell hosts. Sequence confirmed as correct!

                Probably authentic construct sequence, and has N-terminal TEV cleavage site. But this is isoform beta-1 (P45983-3). The Harvard plasmid is isoform alpha-1 (P45983-1), and the UniProt canonical isoform is alpha-2 (P45983-2). The latter two isoforms are identical except for a region at the C-terminus, outside the catalytic domain. Downweighting this construct results in 2NO3_A becoming the top-ranked sequence.

            Paper doesn't appear to mention sequence, but the PDB SEQRES records are identical to a number of other PDB entries, including 3O2M, from which the construct sequence can be confirmed as correct. Note that the PDB construct includes mutations T183E and Y185E.

            Paper cites Zhang et al 2006. TODO

            Paper doesn't appear to mention the sequence or expression protocol, but PDB SEQRES records look likely to be authentic.

            Paper SI confirms E coli expression, expression tag (His tag and TEV protease cleavage site), and sequence.
